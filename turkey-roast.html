 <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
    <p>This is a <strong> delicious marinade</strong> used for a boneless turkey breast roast.</p> 

<h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>

<p>  <ul>

<li>quarter cup olive oil</li>
<li>quarter cup soy sauce</li>
<li>3 cloves garlic, minced, or more to taste</li>
<li>2 tbsp brown sugar</li>
<li>2 teaspoon dried basil</li>
<li>3 pound boneless turkey breast</li>
<li>salt and ground pepper to taste</li>

</ul>

</p>

<h2>DIRECTIONS</h2>
<p> 
 <ol>
    <li>Whisk olive oil, soy sauce, garlic, brown sugar, and basil together in a bowl and pour into a resealable plastic bag. Add turkey breast, coat with the marinade, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator, 8 hours to overnight.</li>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190degrees C). Line a roasting pan with aluminium foil.</li>
    <li>Remove turkey breast from the marinade and shake off excess. Place turkey in the prepared roasting pan and season with salt and pepper. Set remaining marinade aside.</li>
    <li>Cook turkey in the preheated oven for one hour. Baste with the reserved marinade and cook <span><strong>until no longer pink in the centre</span></strong> and the juice run clear, about 20 more minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F(77 degrees C).</li>
