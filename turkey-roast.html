    <img

 <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
<p>This is a delicious marinade used for a boneless turkey breast roast.</p> 

<h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>

<p>  <ul>

<li>quarter cup olive oil</li>
<li>quarter cup soy sauce</li>
<li>3 cloves garlic, minced, or more to taste</li>
<li>2 tbsp brown sugar</li>
<li>2 teaspoon dried basil</li>
<li>3 pound boneless turkey breast</li>
<li>salt and ground pepper to taste</li>

</ul>

</p>

<h2>DIRECTIONS</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Whisk olive oil, soy sauce, garlic, brown sugar, and basil together in a bowl and pour into a resealable plastic bag. Add turkey breast, coat with the marinade, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator, 8 hours to overnight.</li>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190degrees C). Line a roasting pan with aluminium foil.</li>
    <li>Remove turkey breast from the marinade and shake off excess. Place turkey in the prepared roasting pan and season with salt and pepper. Set remaining marinade aside.</li>
    <li>Cook turkey in the preheated oven for one hour. Baste with the reserved marinade and cook until no longer pink in the centre and the juice run clear, about 20 more minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F(77 degrees C).</li>
